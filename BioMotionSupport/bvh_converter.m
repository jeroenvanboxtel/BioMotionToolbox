function jointinfo = bvh_converter(filename,dotnum)
% This code reads in a bvh file and generates a .data3d.txt file. The
% .data3d.txt is the file that is the default input for the BioMotion
% class.
%
% Usage: bvhconverter(filename [,dotnum])
%
% filename: give the full filename, including extension
%
% dotnum, the indices of the joints you want to scan
%
% We tested it on several datasets. In some datesets the order of
% xyz is different, which will cause the action to be rotated when
% displayed with the default settings of the BioMotion class. This can be
% corrected with the .Rotation or .RotatePath() functionality in the
% BioMotion class, or with the dimchange argument in this function.
%
% HL: finalized version done on 8/20
% JvB: cleaned up, use dlmwrite(), and made such that dotnum is optional.
